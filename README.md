JavaScript – Warm Up

This project serves as an introduction to JavaScript programming using Node.js. It focuses on basic syntax, working with variables, loops, conditionals, and command-line arguments. Each script was created to perform a specific task while following a set of constraints to help build a solid understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts.

Throughout the exercises, all output is printed using the console.log(...) function, and the var keyword is strictly avoided in favor of const and let, which promote better coding practices and variable scope management. Each script can be executed directly from the terminal using Node.js by running node <script_name>.js followed by any required arguments.

The first few scripts focus on simple printing and string manipulation. For instance, the initial script prints the message “JavaScript is amazing,” introducing the use of const for defining variables. The next script expands on this by printing multiple lines using console.log, demonstrating how to handle multiple outputs.

Subsequent tasks explore handling command-line arguments through process.argv. These scripts determine whether arguments have been passed, count them, or display their values in specific formats. Examples include printing messages such as “No argument,” “Argument found,” or “Arguments found,” depending on user input. Another script prints the first or multiple arguments in formatted output, such as “C is fun,” “Python is cool,” or combining arguments in the format “C is cool.”

The project also introduces numeric conversions using Number.parseInt and basic control flow. One script checks whether the first argument can be converted into an integer and prints either “My number: <integer>” or “Not a number.” Another script takes an integer argument and prints the phrase “C is fun” multiple times using loops, further emphasizing iteration and condition handling.

Building upon these principles, the project includes a script that prints a square made of the character X, where the size is specified by the first argument. If no valid size is provided, the program displays “Missing size.” This demonstrates practical use of loops and string manipulation through the .repeat() method.

Finally, the last task involves defining a function named add(a, b) that takes two integers as input and prints their sum. This introduces function creation and reinforces the concept of code reusability.

In summary, this project provides a foundational understanding of JavaScript’s syntax and logic structure. Through simple, clear exercises, it teaches how to use constants, loops, functions, and command-line arguments effectively. These scripts mark an essential first step toward mastering JavaScript and developing more complex applications in the future.
